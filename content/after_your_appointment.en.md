## Before you start

You should have had a phone or face-to-face appointment with a Pension Wise guidance specialist.

Some information in the summary may not apply if during your appointment we found that you:

- have a Section 32 arrangement – you may not be able to transfer your pension
- are already taking an adjustable income (receiving income from a drawdown arrangement)
- have inherited your pension pot – the amount of tax you pay will be different
- have a fixed term annuity and a maturity amount is payable

In these cases all the options may not be available. You’ll need to contact your provider for more details.

^If you haven’t yet had a Pension Wise appointment, you can [book an appointment](/en/appointments).^
