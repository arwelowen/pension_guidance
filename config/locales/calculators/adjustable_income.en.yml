            Based on what you’ve told us, if you use your %{pot_value} pension pot to take an adjustable income, you could get:

            <strong class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-tax-free-lump-sum">%{estimate} tax free</strong>

            and

            <strong class="calculator__estimate__number">
              a monthly income of <span class="calculator__highlight">%{drawdown_amount}</span>
              until you’re <span class="t-calculator-age-for-desired-income calculator__highlight">%{until_age}</span>

              Average life expectancy for those aged 55 is mid-to-late 80s. A monthly income of %{monthly_income}
              could last until you’re %{until_age}, though you could live longer.
