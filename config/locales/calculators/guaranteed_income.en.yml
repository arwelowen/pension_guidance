            Based on what you’ve told us, if you use your %{pot_value} pension pot to buy an annuity, you could get:

            <strong class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-tax-free-lump-sum">%{estimate} tax free</strong>

            and get:

            <strong class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-income">
              %{income} guaranteed annual taxable income, for the rest of your life
            </strong>

            <li>This estimate is for a single-life annuity.</li>
            <li>
              You may be better off with a joint-life annuity that pays your spouse or partner after you die,
              or an enhanced annuity which pays more if you smoke or have a medical condition.
            </li>
            <li>If you’re in Scotland your calculation will be different.</li>
