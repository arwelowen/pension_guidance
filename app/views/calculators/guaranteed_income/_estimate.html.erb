<p>
  Based on what you’ve told us, if you use your <%= number_to_currency(pot) %> pension pot to buy an annuity, you could get:

  <strong class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-tax-free-lump-sum">
    <%= number_to_currency(estimate[:tax_free_lump_sum]) %> tax free
  </strong>

  and get:

  <strong class="calculator__estimate__number t-calculator-income">
    <%= number_to_currency(estimate[:income]) %> guaranteed annual taxable income, for the rest of your life
  </strong>
</p>

<ul class="t-calculator-notes">
  <li>This estimate is for a single-life annuity.</li>
  <li>You may be better off with a joint-life annuity that pays your spouse or partner after you die, or an enhanced annuity which pays more if you smoke or have a medical condition.</li>
  <li>If you’re in Scotland your calculation will be different.</li>
</ul>
